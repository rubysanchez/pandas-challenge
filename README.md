This is my homework assignment for the Heroes of Pymoli challenge 

Three observable trends in the data:

1. The overwhelming majority of players are male. 

2. Regardless of age, it seems that the 20-24 age group is the most active. 

3. Although male players make up the majority of players, they tend to have a lower average total purchase per person.
